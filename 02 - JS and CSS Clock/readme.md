I'm learning programming with wesbos and his project: JavaScript30
I made with them: Clock.

I am using JavaScript and CSS.
In CSS the greates challenge was create the hands of clock (location them using transform and transition).

In JavaScipt the most diffucult was calculate the posiotons of hands of closks, especially hours.
