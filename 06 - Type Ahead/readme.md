I'm learning programming with wesbos and his project: JavaScript30 I made with them:
** Ajax Type Ahead **

We could put the name of the city or state and the application find it.
I get the data into cities using API and method  fetch. To find the cities I used to  spread (part of ES6) - to  change array into individual arguments. (...data).
